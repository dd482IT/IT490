## Home 
The home page is still in progress. We have one ready but it will be the main page for crytpo data and community interaction. The data will include...
1. Coin Prices 
2. Coin Performance 
3. High Scores 
4. Weekly Events

## Login 

The login page works as expected, a user can login and continue to the home page/ game page.

## Profile

The profile page structure is ready but more tables need to be created to expand the data that is displayed. This data will mainly be game related.

## Game 

The crypto game itself is currently at a good baseline and just needs to be connected into the project as a whole.
